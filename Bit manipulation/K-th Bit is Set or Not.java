/**
K-th Bit is Set or Not
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 52.75%Submissions: 223K+Points: 2
Given a number n and a bit number k, check if the kth index bit of n is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. The position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from the LSB side in the binary representation of the number.
Note: Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false.

Examples : 

Input: n = 4, k = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 2nd index bit from LSB is set. So, return true.
Input: n = 500, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is 111110100, in which 3rd index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
0 ≤ k ≤ 31
