/*
Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'. You must return the index of the lower bound of 'x'.



Note:
1. For a sorted array 'arr', 'lower_bound' of a number 'x' is defined as the smallest index 'idx' such that the value 'arr[idx]' is not less than 'x'.If all numbers are smaller than 'x', then 'n' should be the 'lower_bound' of 'x', where 'n' is the size of array.

2. Try to do this in O(log(n)).


Example:
Input: ‘arr’ = [1, 2, 2, 3] and 'x' = 0

Output: 0

Explanation: Index '0' is the smallest index such that 'arr[0]' is not less than 'x'.

Constraints:
1 <= ‘n’ <= 10^5
0 <= ‘arr[i]’ <= 10^5
1 <= ‘x’ <= 10^5
